        In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk,
        usually supporting branches and leaves. In some usages, the definition
        of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary
        growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified
        height. In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and
        bamboos are also trees. Trees are not a monophyletic taxonomic group but
        consist of a wide variety of plant species that have independently
        evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to
        compete for sunlight. The majority of tree species are angiosperms or
        hardwoods; of the rest, many are gymnosperms or softwoods. Trees tend to
        be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. Trees have been
        in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are
        around three trillion mature trees in the world.
